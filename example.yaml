alt: 377 # m
timezone: 8.0 # hours relative to UTC -- the local date (YYYY-MM-DD) of each local solar noon will be used
              # as a unique identifier of each day's observing. Actual observations for that day will be
              # scheduled within 0.5 sidereal days of the local solar noon.
